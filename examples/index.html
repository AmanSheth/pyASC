            <p>Welcome to the Maryland All Sky Network website. The goal of the network is to collect nightly images of meteors. With this data, we
			hope we will be able to better locate meteorites. We hope to eventually expand this network to more cameras and be able to process more
            data. This is intended to be the place where one can find the results of the processed data gathered by the network.
            </p>
            <p>This project has been worked on by students in the Science, Discovery and the Universe Scholars Program at the University of Maryland-College
                Park, as well as high school students from Haiti. Both Elizabeth Warner and Dr. Peter Teuben served as mentors for this project. The students
                worked on implementing the Astride program to work with our images, automating the program, making the program more user friendly, and 
                building this website to display our findings to the public.

            <p>Currently the Maryland All Sky Network is composed of 1 Starlight Xpress Oculus Camera. The camera runs from sunset to sunrise, taking
			thousands of photos. The photos have exposure times between 25 and 55 seconds depending on the conditions that night. These photos are then
            run through a program called Astride, which is a streak-detection software developed by Dae-Won Kim. Above, you can see an example of a photo
            of a meteor and how astride processes the image to detect where the streak is. In addition, we are experimenting with
			difference imaging as another form of streak detection.
