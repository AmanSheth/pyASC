python with an All Sky Camera
=============================

This project describes not only the set up of the camera and associated software on the connected computer, it also helps you set up a server, and associated python code to perform some image processing. Lots of example scripts and image inventory logs are kept here as well.

Our currrent camera in the Maryland All Sky Network (and hopelly soon the Haiti All Sky Camera, HASC) use an Oculus all sky camera from Starlight Express (http://www.optcorp.com/starlight-xpress-oculus-all-sky-camera.html). Most of our cameras use the 180 degree lens, though we have one lens to experiment with the finer resolution 150 degree lens.
