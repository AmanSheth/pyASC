The currrent all sky camera we describe here is the Oculus Starlight Xpress.

This camera needs no power, just a 5V USB connection, unless you want to use the
heater in certain moist environments to ensure that the dome does not fog up.


For remote operations without power you could use as laptop or raspberry pi, perhaps
aided with a daily charged solar cell array. Assuming you have large capacity storage,
you can leave this setup unattended for several days or weeks.
