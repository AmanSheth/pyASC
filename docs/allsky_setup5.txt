March 2017:  setup notes for raspberry pi 3
===========================================

0) Sadly, the RP3 that we got was preloaded with some annoying
   (citrix?) bloatware, with no root access that made us go through
   hoops to even run "apt install".  So decided to grab the latest
   true RASPIAN distro:

1) grab the full raspian version, not the lite, for development. This
   version has the PIXEL windowing system. The lite version has no
   graphical interface. Both have username "pi" as default, and if you
   need a password, it's "raspberry".

   It's possible we will give instructions how to deal with the lite
   version, as this may be a more efficient way to distribute production
   images.

   wget -c http://director.downloads.raspberrypi.org/......zip
   unzip ...zip
   dd bs=1M if=...img of=/dev/mm...

   This microSD is now ready for boot in your RP3.

2) Boot the RP3 with this freshly imaged RP3.  During the boot this image will be modified.

3) A number of tools will be needed for INDI development. This will cost some download time, be
   prepared for long waits if you're on a slow link to the internet.

   sudo apt install cdbs libcfitsio3-dev libnova-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libjpeg-dev libusb-dev libtiff5-dev libftdi-dev fxload libkrb5-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libraw-dev libgphoto2-dev libgsl0-dev dkms libboost-regex-dev libgps-dev libdc1394-22-dev

   then grab the latest libinfi for RPI

   tar -xzf libindi_1.4.1_rpi.tar.gz
   cd libindi_1.4.1_rpi
   sudo dpkg -i *.deb

4) For the python interface, pyindi-client is the preferred route, but you will need two more tools for this.

   sudo apt install swig python-dev
   sudo pip install pyindi-client


   wget -c http://indilib.org/download/raspberry-pi/send/6-raspberry-pi/9-indi-library-for-raspberry-pi.html
   mv 9-indi-library-for-raspberry-pi.html libindi_1.4.1_rpi.tar.gz 
   tar -xzf libindi_1.4.1_rpi.tar.gz
   cd libindi_1.4.1_rpi
   sudo dpkg -i *.deb
