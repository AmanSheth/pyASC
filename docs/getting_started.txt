- make sure you have something like anaconda3 installed,
  in the terminal type
     	 which python
  and make sure you have that python3 from anaconda3

- Test is pyASC is working, type the commands in the terminal

     cd pyASC/ASC
     git checkout master     (git fetch --all upstream; git merge upstream/master)
     git pull
     ./ASCube.py

  and make sure there are no module errors.  Notice we are first
  updating the pyASC software to make sure we're always up to date.

  Common problems could be:

  1) ImportError: No module named astropy.io

  Solution:
	pip install astropy

  2) ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aplpy'

  Solution:

	pip install aplpy


  
- To test some interesting modules to work with, we have two script

      ./MakeCube.py --help
  and
  
      ./MakeDownsampledCube.py  --help

- grab a sample dataset e.g. 20151108_MD01_raw from:
  from http://www.astro.umd.edu/openhouse/obs-data/allsky/20151108_MD01_raw.zip

  Once you have unzipped it, you will see filenames such as

  IMG01329.FIT

  Try the ds9 program to view this. You will notice the image is east-west flipped,
  which is a "problem" with ds9.  To flip it, use "Zoom -> Invert X" from the top
  tabs.

- Install astride:


  git clone https://github.com/dwkim78/ASTRiDE
  cd ASTRiDE
  python setup.py install
         (this may need python to install something in scikit-image if your python doesn't have it yet)
         (this can also take a long time)

- make a test directory with only 20 fits files around the interesting IMG01329.FIT file:

  cd pyASC/examples
  mkdir test2015
  cp ../../20151108_MD01_raw/IMG0132*.FIT test2015/
  cp ../../20151108_MD01_raw/IMG0133*.FIT test2015/


- To try astride on a series of images in the test2015
  (again, if you have missing modules, try "pip install" those)



  cd pyASC/examples/test2015
  ../try_astride.pyp

  Click on OK twice (why???? i dunno yet)
  hit enter to pick the defaults on the questions you get, and observe what it's doing
  ...
  you should see it working on 20 files. will take a bit. Can take fewer, as long as
  01329 is part of the series.

- try and understand the command line parameters via


        ../try_astride.py --help

  and see if you can get it working without the file browser
