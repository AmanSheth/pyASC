- make sure you have something like anaconda3 installed,
  in the terminal type
     	 which python
  and make sure you have that python3 from anaconda3

- Test is pyASC is working, type the commands in the terminal

     cd pyASC/ASC
     git checkout master
     git pull
     ./ASCube.py

  and make sure there are no module errors.  Notice we are first
  updating the pyASC software to make sure we're always up to date.

  Common problems could be:

  1) ImportError: No module named astropy.io

  Solution:
	pip install astropy

  2) ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aplpy'

  Solution:

	pip install aplpy
