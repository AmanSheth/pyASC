my Dec 2016 notes to install INDI and such on Centos6.4 for HASC:


- the server was fairly minimal, had to "yum install" a fair amount
  (some of them possibly not needed; from older notes from Lowell)

  yum install cmake
  yum install gcc
  yum install gcc-c++
  yum install saoimage
  yum install xpa-devel xpa
  yum install libudev-devel
  yum install libusb-devel
  yum install tcsh autogen 
  yum install tigervnc-server
  yum install gtk2-devel

- recall rpm commands:

  rpm -ql PACKAGE       # lists files in a PACKAGE
  rpm -qa               # lists all packages
  rpm -qf FILE          # lists package that belongs to a FILE

Mesa All Sky Camera setup notes:
--------------------------------
On allsky.lowell.edu
1) Len installed a vanilla version of Fedora Core 21
2) GoQat:
 a) I imported the goqat-1.0.3.tar.gz from canburytech.net/GoQat
 b) tar xvfz goqat-1.0.3.tar.gz
 c) Install a bunch of stuff that GoQat will need to compile:

 As root:
 g++ - prompts to install:
    gcc-c++  which needs
    libstdc++-devel-4.9.2-1.fc21..x86_64

 Already Installed:
 pkgconfig, gawk, gtk2, libXt-devel

 Install:
 yum install tcsh autogen (gc, guile)

 yum install libstdc++-devel-4.9.2-1.fc21.x86_64
 yum install gcc-c++
 yum install gtk2-devel
 yum install libusb-devel
 yum install libv4l-devel
 yum install goocanvas-devel (goocanvas)
 yum install libudev-devel (gets systemd-devel)
 yum install libraw1394-devel
 yum install xpa-devel xpa
 yum install saoimage
 yum install grace grace-devel
 yum install libunicapgtk-devel

 Mods to get it to compile:
 d) fedora puts xpa headers in /usr/include/xpa/, instead of /usr/include
 e) /usr/include/xpa/xpa.h change #include <prsetup.h> to <xpa/prsetup.h>
    src/image.c - change #include <xpa.h> to #include <xpa/xpa.h>

 f) ./configure
 g) make
 h) sudo make install
    This installs everything under /usr/local/ by default.

3) SAO DS9: Download ds9 from ds9.si.edu/site/Download.html
   tar xvfz ds9*.gz
   sudo mv ds9 /usr/local/bin

   install libXss for ds9
     yum install libXScrnSaver

4) Plug in the Oculus camera to a usb port.  
   The camera will show up on /dev/bus/usb/00M/0NN and the permission
   will need to be made world readable

   csh> sudo chmod 0666 `lsusb | grep Starlight | sed -e 's/://' |\
        awk '{print "/dev/bus/usb/"$2"/"$4}' -`

5) yum install tigervnc-server
