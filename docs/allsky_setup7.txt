July 2018:  setup notes for Ubuntu 18.04


1) pre-conditions on Ubuntu

# needs gtk+-3.0 and a few other things for essential compilation
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
sudo apt install libgoocanvas-2.0-dev
sudo apt install libudev-dev

# and highly recommended:
sudo apt install libxpa-dev
sudo apt install libusb-1.0

# and DS9 and XPA tools are now available in standard package manager
sudo apt install saods9 xpa-tools

2) get the GoQat source:


   wget http://canburytech.net/GoQat/download/goqat-2.1.3.tar.gz
   tar zxf goqat-2.1.3.tar.gz
   cd goqat-2.1.3

3) configure and compile


  ./configure
		-> still complaining no INDI library support
   make
   sudo make install
   
   -> This installs everything under /usr/local/ by default, only bin/GoQat actually for now.


4) Plug in the Oculus camera to a usb port.  
   The camera will show up on /dev/bus/usb/00M/0NN and the permission
   will need to be made world readable

   csh> sudo chmod 0666 `lsusb | grep Starlight | sed -e 's/://' |\
        awk '{print "/dev/bus/usb/"$2"/"$4}' -`

   this is now implemented in a script in docs/starlight_usb_on

5) install a VNC viewer: (vncviewer, remmina)
   This is useful if you remotely need to connect to the machine taking data

   sudo apt install xtightvncviewer




To work in python you need a few more, if you don't have them:
See also the examples in
   http://indilib.org/develop/tutorials/151-time-lapse-astrophotography-with-indi-python.html


sudo apt-get install subversion python-dev swig cmake

#  sudo apt-get install indi-bin libindi-dev
sudo apt-get install indi-sx
(if indi-sx doesn't exist,  you cannot use that default repository, see below for a private repo that has it)


there's instructions for RPI as well.



Haiti computer from scratch

apt install:
  libindi-dev
  subversion
  python-dev
  swig
  cmake
  indi-bin
  libgtk-3-dev
  libgoocanvas-2.0-dev
  libudev-dev
  libxpa-dev

Issues:   in later libindi  it does not come with the needed indi_sx_ccd driver,
better to use this one:


From : http://indilib.org/download/ubuntu.html

From source:  http://indilib.org/download/source/send/2-source/11-3rd-party-indi-drivers.html

From repo:
  sudo apt-add-repository ppa:mutlaqja/ppa
  sudo apt-get update
  # sudo apt-get install indi-full
  sudo apt-get install libindi1 indi-bin indi-sx
       then installs: (~9MB)
                indi-bin indi-sx libindi-data libindi1 libnova-0.14-0


# http://indilib.org/forum/general/13-command-line-client-for-indiserver-indi-sx-ccd.html
It seems, that driver is crashing for some reason.
Usual reason is, that USB device is readonly because of missing 99-sx.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d. Peter

# melissa:
apt install  indi-bin  indi-sx         (does a few other needed)

# if all is working with GoQat (installed and USB device set)

   cameras -> connect to camera
   exposure:  0.2 sec
   start exposure
   then ds9 should display the image (ccd_display.fit)
